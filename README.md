# Day-and-Night-Octave
Day and Night is a cellular automaton rule in the same family as Game of Life. It is defined by the following rules:
1) A dead cell becomes live (is born) if it has 3, 6, 7, or 8 live neighbors
2) A live cell remains alive (survives) if it has 3, 4, 6, 7, or 8 live neighbors, out of the eight neighbors in the Moore neighborhood.

   In this project, the automaton is implemented using GNU Octave.
